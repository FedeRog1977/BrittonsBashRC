## Significance

* GROWTH @ 1% Significance Level 
* LIQ @ 1% Significance Level 

The p-value associated with the growth variable (0.0001) is < 0.01 therefore, the coefficient is significant at the 1% level. The coefficient states that with a 1 unit increase in a country's growth ('enter name of growth metric here - I can't remember'), there is a 0.002369 unit decrease in a country's Z-Score ('enter name of what the Z-Score metric means here - I can't remember'). Therefore, the null hypothesis that a country's growth does not have a significant effect on a country's Z-Score is **rejected** in favour of the alternative hypothesis that growth does have an effect on Z-Score (don't use the phrase 'Z-Score', use the real meaning of Z-Score, risk?), stated with 99% confidence (due to 1% significance level).

The p-value associated with the liquidity variable (0.0031) is < 0.01 therefore, the coefficient is significant at the 1% level. The coefficient states that with a 1 unit increase in a country's liquidity, there is a 8.4344 unit increase in a country's Z-Score. Therefore, the null hypothesis that a country's liquidity does not have significant effect on a country's Z-Score is **rejected** in favour of the alternative hypothesis that liquidity does have an effect on Z-Score, stated with 99% confidence (due to 1% significance level).

## Robustness

*This is additional, unrequired but relevant content*  

The R^2 ('R-Squared') value of 0.451112 shows that the selection of variables selected are responsible for and can statistically explain 45.11% of the variation in dependent variable, Z-Score.
