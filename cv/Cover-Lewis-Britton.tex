% WHY BARCLAYS
\section{What I Will Offer}

\subsection{Barclays Specific}

I am a fan of the Barclays name. The Barclays cultural and societal inclusion system is straight-to-the-point with minimal bloat. I respect the system. Specifically, I take great interest in wealth management. My respect for and practice with accuracy and logic perfectly matches the punctual nature of combining necessary communication mehtods with comma-separated value environment management. As has been displayed through previous employment, my communication, literacy, accent, verbal respect, interpretation, understanding, empathy, care and delivery is of high-standard and in favour of clients. Request reference, if required.\\

Regarding remote communication, I am familiar with various CSV environments, primarily SC-IM and Microsoft Excel. I communicate logically and pragmatically with the correct amount of empathy, tone and emotion. I am familiar with more efficeint methods of electronic mail and telecommunication,  for example through my mail client: mutt and, though my Cisco CP-7962G. Having managed my own `wealth', investments and cash flows extremely efficiently for five years now, I have the skill it takes to translate my results to clients. My efficiency and decision making is in favour of sustainable growth, in respect of the client and myself.

\subsection{Additional}

I have the ability to adapt and change to suit new and developing situations and tasks which will allow a consistent flow in operations. Showing my determination and stamina through new opportunities, relations and experiences to adopt new skills and knowledge is an important part of service to me also. Which all would enhance the clientâ€™s experience. I find it thrilling to set and also attain high goals and expectations and respond to pressure due to my competitive and punctual nature. This further motivates me to put across my efficient and logical structure to create systems of efficiency.\\

Teamwork is equally as important to me as self-management and leadership and I believe that I make an excellent listener and learner. And most importantly of all to me, is integrity. Good service is not fulfilled without honesty, respect, trust and loyalty. Which are all attributes I believe I take pride in owning. I would always use this to provide the best service I possibly could.
