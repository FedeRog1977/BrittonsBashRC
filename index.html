		<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<img src="Linkedin.jpeg" alt="lewis">

			<p>
			We spend far too much time relying on the big three. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have become the landlords of the internet and although this is their well-deserved position, we should not be slaves to their UI restrictions! The internet exists in the same way good capitalist markets do. Of course the big three deserve the majority share, but we also need our inferior middle classes to fully utilise our available online space. 
			</p>	

			<p>
			I am a fourth year student at the University of Strathclyde, studying Finance & Economics. I achieved distinction in third year and plan to focus study on asset pricing, quantitative methods, advanced corporate strategies and international finance, in fourth year. Provided I acquire the necessary grades, I plan to proceed to fifth year studying MSc in Quantitative Finance.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I have 'work experience' in various areas including financial and insurance operations, retail and entrepreneurism. These include experience at organisations such as Sedgwick Group, Lakeland Ltd., J Sainsbury Plc., and my own company, Virtuous Truffle Company. These have allowed me to display my ability to efficiently set and attain high-standard goals, organise and structure plans in great depth, and maintain a strong work ethic and balance. Integrity has been an important asset of mine, displayed in these opportunities. Maintaining honesty and respect has allowed me to satisfy the right people while paying off.

				If you're interested, I scripted this site in my terminal-based text editor of choice, Vim. Or, Vi Improved if you will. It is an expansive and very powerful text editor, allowing maximum workflow management and optimisation. You can install and access this text editor through any terminal emulator. The one I'm currently dailying is Terminal (for MacOS). I registered my unique domain with <a href="https://www.epik.com">Epik</a>. I host my site on <a href="https://www.github.com">Github Pages</a>.
