			<p>
				This section of brittonsbashrc explores various opinions held by myself. I will use this section to express my response to common social and cultural ideas, trends and mis-beliefs. In addition to my response to current irrational bias in politics and the classic and modern media - news etc. and social media.
			<br><br>
				This will initially be composed of two primary features: <b>BlogShell</b> and <b>DebunkQuickie</b>. BlogShell will consist of a series of links to blog posts which dive into deep political ideas, personal thoughts and modern media exploration. Any statements made will be enforced by objective fact and strong references. The main idea will still be portrayed however, by a conclusive personal opinion. DebunkQuickie will consist of a series of short statements available on this main page which address issues I immediately feel the need to challenge and oppose. These could come from media etc. or simply conversation. They will lack references but will still contain common objective fact and rational decision-making and opinions.

			<h2>DebunkQuickie</h2>

				<h3>“Wages should be consistent” - FALSE</h3>

				<p>
					I do not believe a wage is the correct way to incentivise productivity in the majority of career paths. I believe cash flow should directly reflect your ability to perform and delivery. A good existing example of this is real estate. Brokers are paid a wage by the brokerage simply due to standard employment regulation. However, their real income stems from commission on closing deals and selling properties. This averages ~3% in New York City. This is an accurate way of reflecting the broker’s performance - I.e. they have arranged redevelopments, faced homes, held open-houses, managed the majority of the paperwork, been an intermediary to architects, interior designers etc. and, found the final buyer. Therefore, it is only appropriate that their final pay is a directly proportionate cut of the final selling price of the home - as the selling price reflects the hierarchical level of the property, which reflects the level of effort and productivity required to seek the final output. 
					<br><br>
					A good example of a role which requires this upgrade is research and development. For example, at a technology corporation or university etc. I have a strict ‘no reference’ rule for this feature however, there have been studies conducted which show high payoff potential conclusions to research are more incentivising than a low consistent wage. Therefore, it would make far more sense to reward researchers proportionately to what they achieve. Supplemented by a minimum employment wage, in-line with employment regulation. People have been found to become more motivated and effective when (1) they don’t have a good wage to rely on and (2) they have opportunity to take more risk for more payoff. Thus, the std.dev from the original mean pay-off/wage increases drastically.
				</p>

				<h3>“You’re rich Lewis, you can buy anything you want” - FALSE</h3>

				<p>
					I do not consider rich to be tied to a position to buy something or having a certain number associated with your checking or savings account etc. I don’t believe if you have a $2m car or $40m house that you are rich. To truly be ‘rich’ in wealth, I believe that you must have projected subsequent cash flows in perpetuity which will replenish cash used to purchase absolutely anything at any point in time. For example, you buy a yacht for $10m, you are not rich simply because you own this yacht. I would consider you to be ‘rich’ if you had a cash flow next month of $11m, thus replacing the cost of the yacht. You should then subsequently have the cash flows which would allow you to repeat this every month, or repeating every period you consider to be a cash flow period - e.g. quarter, semi-annually etc.
				</p>

				<h3>“Sweating more is a sign of good health” - FALSE</h3>

				<p>
					This is a very poor and narrow statement as you will not sweat more simply because you are fitter. If however, because you are fitter, you tend on average to walk, run, cycle etc. faster, the excessive sweating can be attributed to this. Greater levels of fitness has been found to correlate with reduced sweating. Therefore, if you are a practicer in good fitness, excessive sweating can be explained by a greater probability of sweating brought by your increased pace, than there is reduced probability of sweating from better fitness.
