# Strengths in Practice

* Organisation & Structure – Having had OCD as a child, organisation and structure comes naturally to me now. With my early start to the day, bed made, exercise, this sets up well for structure. Aiding this is my constant use of planning seen in my daily Timetables, relative To Do lists and other domestic relate planners. 
* Efficiency – Stemming from a busy lifestyle, coding and cooking etc., I am efficient when it comes to multitasking and received excellent feedback on multiple occasions regarding my efficiency front of house at Sainsbury’s. 
* Accuracy & Care – Being exposed to antique, high quality goods from a young age, I was raised to appreciate and respect quality and care of my own and other people’s property which is why it was so important to me at Sainsbury’s that my service at tills was delivered with very much care. This came with very positive feedback from many customers.
* Problem Solving & Innovation – Having gone through weight loss, bullying, loneliness, anorexia and other issues, I have found myself having to create and build solutions on my own, on many occasions. This has given me good ability to create my own way into and out of situations. I also have an artistic side see in in things like CAD and DTP hobbies which highlight innovation.
* Efficiency Under Pressure – I tend to put myself under pressure a lot simply because I work better when faced by it. This was highlighted in situations at Sainsbury’s where I may have been left alone on the shop floor at rush hour etc., where I would be managing all aspects alone or with one other individual.
* Integrity – Honesty is number one to me. I am a big believer in what goes around comes around and if you practice honesty, even if it may not seem right it will always be the right thing to do. This method helped me beat many insecurities such as intimidation and social awkwardness. 
* Time Management – Refrigeration rotation. Close watching of my watch. A good mental clock. An ability to summarise and clarify well in a short space of time.
* Determination & Stamina – A natural drive to see happy customers. At Sainsbury’s this was fulfilled by presenting the store well and ensuring there my service at tills was efficient and stock was handled correctly.
* Unity & Empathy – Put in front of house at tills in previous job 9/10 times as I have an ability to interact and empathise accordingly with the customers.
